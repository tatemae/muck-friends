NOTE: the jquery.autocomplete.pack.js file is modified from the original to work with luvfoo.  Specifically line
 314 was changed from
   if ( data && data.length && hasFocus ) {
 to
   if ( data && data.length ) {
 For some reason the hasFocus value was always 0 which prevented the autocomplete from ever showing up.
